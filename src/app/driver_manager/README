The purpose of the driver manager is to launch certain device drivers once the
corresponding devices become available. On the Zynq platform, this may occur
as a consequence of loading a custom bitstream into the FPGA. For this purpose,
the device manager opens a ROM session with label 'devices' by which it is
provided with the list of devices in the form a platform-driver-compatible
config ROM. Furthermore, it generates a report containing an init config that
can be routed to an arbitrary sub-init.

The decision what drivers to start is provided by the config ROM so that the
driver manager can be used with arbitrary bitstreams and driver components.
The config may contain an arbitrary number of '<driver>' nodes with the
mandatory attributes 'name' and 'device'. The 'device' attribute determines the
type of the device to look for whereas the 'name' attribute specifies the name
of the component to be started once the device became available.
In other words, the device driver will add a '<start>' node in the generated
report with the provided name and the content of the '<driver>' node.

An examplary configuration of the component is shown below:

! <config>
!   <driver name="nic" device="zynq_gem0">
!     <binary name="zynq_nic"/>
!     [...]
!   </driver>
! </config>
