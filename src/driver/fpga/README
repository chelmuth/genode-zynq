Driver for powering, initialising and configuring a Xilinx FPGA via the
PCAP interface.

An examplary configuration of the component is shown below:

! <config>
!   <bitstream name="fpga.bit" size="0x3dbafc"/>
! </config>

The contains a single 'bitstream' node with a mandatory 'name' and an optional
'size' attribute. The driver will request a ROM session with the provided name
that must contain a valid bitstream file. In 'size' attribute restricts the
length of the bitstream in case a RAW bitstream format without size information
is used. Note that the FPGA is reprogrammed only if the name of the bitstream
changed. If the configuration is incomplete, the driver will reset the FPGA.

The state of the FPGA is reported by the fpga driver as follows:

! <state>
!   <bitstream name="fpga.bit" loaded="yes"/>
! </state>
